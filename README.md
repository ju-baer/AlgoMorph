## 🎯 What is AlgoMorph?

AlgoMorph brings algorithms and data structures to life through **animated, real-time visualizations** and **interactive controls**. You can step through code logic, visualize pointer movements, manipulate data live, and gain deep insights into how things work under the hood.

> _"From code to concept, one morph at a time."_ 🧠
